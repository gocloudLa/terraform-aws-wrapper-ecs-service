    title: Multiple Tasks
    short_description: Supports multiple containers per service with shared Fargate resources
    long_description: |
      The module supports starting more than one container for each service.<br/>
      In this way, the serverless hardware that runs the containers (fargate) is shared.<br/>
      **IMPORTANT** two containers running in the same service can receive requests from the same load balancer, but it is a condition that the containers run on different ports.

    title: Integration with Service Discovery
    short_description: Supports integration with CloudMap / Service Discovery, automates integration.
    long_description: |
      Enables seamless integration with AWS CloudMap (Service Discovery) for service-to-service communication within your VPC.<br/>
      Automatically registers ECS services with CloudMap namespaces, allowing services to discover and communicate with each other using DNS names.<br/>
      **Note**: Only one service discovery configuration is allowed per ECS service.

      Automatically creates CloudWatch Logs subscription filters for ECS service log groups to monitor and alert on critical events.<br/>
      Integrates with the **wrapper_notifications** Lambda function from the foundation level to send notifications when log events match specific patterns.<br/><br/>
      **Current Capabilities:**
      - Monitors JSON-formatted logs for severity levels other than "INFO" or "DEBUG"
      - Sends real-time notifications for ERROR, WARN, FATAL, and other critical log levels
      - Configurable filter patterns (future enhancement)
      
      **Current Filter Pattern:**
      ```
      "{ $.level != \"INFO\" && $.level != \"DEBUG\" }"
      ```

    short_description: Advanced ECR registry scanning and cross-region replication capabilities
    long_description: |
      Provides comprehensive ECR registry management with advanced scanning and replication features.<br/><br/>
      
      **Registry Scanning Configuration:**
      - Enhanced or Basic scanning types with configurable rules
      - Support for SCAN_ON_PUSH and CONTINUOUS_SCAN frequencies
      - Wildcard and prefix-based filtering for targeted scanning
      
      **Registry Replication Configuration:**
      - Cross-region image replication for disaster recovery and performance
      - Configurable destination regions and registry IDs
      - Repository filtering for selective replication
      
      **Image Tag Mutability:**
      - Configurable tag mutability settings (MUTABLE, IMMUTABLE, etc.)
      - Exclusion filters for specific tag patterns
      - Support for wildcard-based tag filtering
